A general many-to-many relation manager with:

* Automatic serialization
* Automatic comparison and set-theory operations
* Classical symbolic operations for sparse addressing (sum, difference, multiplication)
* Generalized dependence lookup by node sets
* Canonical representation of symmetry groups
* Depth-first search from nodes and elements
* Depth-first search for types
* Topological ordering of nodes and elements
* Topological ordering of types
* Lexicographical ordering of all dependence relations
* Automatic instantiation by means of builders

  And much more

The idea is for the user to define a domain-specific "zoo", then create the fauna, and her own domain-specific functions
and avoid any housekeeping
